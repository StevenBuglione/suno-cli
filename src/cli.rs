Which creation command:
  prompt    Build explicit musical directions and a generation command (free)
  write     Compose the song — style prompt + lyric skeleton you fill (free)
  generate  Render audio from lyrics you already have (costs credits)
  describe  Render audio from a one-line description; Suno writes the lyrics
  lyrics    Lyrics text only, no audio (free)

Tips:
  • First run: `suno auth --login`, then `suno doctor` to verify the setup
  • Output is a JSON envelope automatically when piped; force with --json
  • `suno write` and `suno lyrics` are free; standard v6 generation is documented as 10 credits for two songs
  • Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 transient (retry), 2 config/auth, 3 bad input, 4 rate limited
  • Config: `suno config path` shows the file; SUNO_* env vars override it
  • Full machine-readable manifest: `suno agent-info | jq`

Examples:
  suno write --genre \"indie rock\" --theme \"late-night city drives\" --vocal male --out song.txt
  # fill the <...> lyric slots in song.txt, then run the generate command `write` printed:
  suno generate --title \"Night Drive\" --tags \"Indie rock, jangly guitars, warm male vocals, 110 BPM\" --lyrics-file song.txt --wait --download ./songs/
    The full flow: compose, fill, render, download (lyrics embedded in the MP3)

  suno describe --prompt \"a chill lo-fi track about rainy mornings\" --wait --download ./
    Let Suno write the lyrics from a description

  suno list | jq -r '.data.clips[].id'
    List your library as JSON and extract clip IDs

  suno timed-lyrics <clip_id> --lrc > song.lrc
    Word-level synced lyrics in LRC format (raw even when piped)

  suno cover <clip_id> --tags \"jazz, smooth piano\" --wait

// `suno write` help. Agents read --help to learn the command; keep it concrete.
const WRITE_HELP: &str = "\
Tips:
  • --out FILE is the way to get an editable lyrics file: it holds the lyric block ONLY,
    so it feeds `suno generate --lyrics-file` directly. Title/style/tags go to stderr and JSON
  • Shell redirection (`suno write > song.txt`) receives the JSON envelope, not lyrics —
    output is a JSON envelope whenever stdout is not a terminal. Use --out for the lyrics
  • --project-out FILE writes the full human document (title + style prompt + tags + artefact)
  • Fill the <...> placeholders before generating; `suno generate` rejects unresolved ones
  • Genres are fuzzy/case-insensitive; an unknown genre becomes a raw style tag (never fails)
  • --viral adds earworm/hook meta-tags; --instrumental drops all vocals and lyric slots and
    emits a generate command with --instrumental
  • --mode priming requires --target, --objective and --domain (see `suno guide priming`)

Examples:
  suno write --theme \"late-night coding\" --genre indie-rock --vocal male --out song.txt
    Scaffold to song.txt; fill the <...> slots, then run the printed generate command

  suno write --theme \"summer love\" --genre pop --viral --title \"Golden Hour\" --out song.txt
    A pop song with earworm hook tags baked into the style prompt

  suno write --genre lo-fi --instrumental --out beat.txt
    Instrumental lo-fi scaffold — no lyric slots, generatable as written

  suno write --mode priming --domain investment --target \"batch: seed investors\" \\
      --objective \"increase recall of fund X\" --subtlety medium --out song.txt
    Priming research scaffold (chill lounge, 72 BPM) with a Prime-Stack Map template";
